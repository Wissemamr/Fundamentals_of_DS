## Exercise 01:
1.  k= 1 -> Seedless
2. k=3 -> Seeded
3. k=5 -> Seeded 
4. dist = 11 (Euclidean distance)



## Exercise 02 : The least squared regression

### Question :
- Investigate where $a$ and $b$ formulas in $Y = aX + b $ come from
The formula : 
$$ a = \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{Var(X)^2}$$
$$ b = \bar{Y}- a \bar{X} $$
where $a$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept


### Answer :
#### Definition :
Least square regression is a form of mathematical regression analysis used to determine the line of best fit for a set of data, providing a visual demonstration of the relationship between the data points.
